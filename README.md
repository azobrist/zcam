# zdetect
Detect something

## Purpose
Random project to start working on to better understand open source projects and learn more about ML/AI universe. Also like it to be easy to deploy and helps to improve/optimize something in our lives. Specificity is not main goal to start with, more just learning and building an awesome foundation to build on top of. This foundation may then give way to a specific idea, we'll see. Pace of this project is set to "when I have time" mode. I also don't want to blog, so this readme will have plenty of edits and placeholders to help ease brain involvment for a project I don't have time for.

## Scope
Objects:
* license plates
* certain animals
* identify people
* ...
Actions:
* Someone lying down (or someone getting up i.e. bedtime kiddo zombies)
* Determining activity level w/ threshold
* Determine living vs animated objects
* ...

Specificity is not main goal 
Really, no clever single idea but just a desire to build something that can scale.
Main focus for now is to build a hardware and software foundation to be used in many different ways

## Hardware
Pi is obvious choice for price and utility. It's a good chance that as this project grows in complexity that a raspberry pi and it's heavy community can accomplish all necessary tasks. Once hardware design becomse more specific (i.e. battery power, speed optimization), will investigate other hardwares and their capabilities.

Other choices that i've seen or used in past:
* Jetson nano (speed)
* Openmv H7 micro (low power)

## Software
### Language
Python is obvious choice for it's expansive libraries and communities. 

### Libraries
TensorFlow 2.0
PyTorch

## TODO's
* Build camera module with features
  * feature1
* Pi base image with features
  * feature1
